## feed back on prototype walk thru \- Transcript

### 00:00:00

   
**Nimo Parikh:** So, let me go over my stuff first. And it's only like four or five slides, but uh I assume you guys can all see my screen. So, obviously, this thing we're releasing on February 25th where folks will get this basically we'll get this uh notification SMS or email saying, "Hey, your your car was just authorized for $8 at uh City Chiropractic and it looks like it needs a receipt. I mean, your car was authorized. your transaction looks like it needs a receipt and that's where it starts off. Then the second part of it is that it gives you a landing page. So, oh,  
**Jessica Althaus:** But we're not.  
**Nimo Parikh:** let me just go No,  
**Jessica Althaus:** This isn't what we're releasing in February, though.  
**Nimo Parikh:** no, no, no.  
**Jessica Althaus:** Okay.  
**Nimo Parikh:** This is this is just the mockup to say that this is what we want the flow to  
**Jessica Althaus:** All right. Yes, that's I thought that's what you said,  
**Nimo Parikh:** be.  
**Jessica Althaus:** so I was like just making sure you do.  
   
 

### 00:00:49

   
**Nimo Parikh:** No, no. Sorry if I said that incorrectly.  
**Jessica Althaus:** Okay.  
**Nimo Parikh:** No,  
**Jessica Althaus:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** so this is just the prototype of the mockup that we want. Um, and then obviously this is after the person gets the initial notification that, hey, your card was just authorized at, you know, City Chiropractic for $80. And then it'll say this transaction looks like it needs a receipt. Click here to upload your receipt. They click onto this. They see receipt required and it gives them this information, maybe something similar. They take the photo of the receipt and then the one thing I wanted to do was he have him at is like a clock because it takes about 10 to 15 seconds for the AI claims to basically absorb the picture. Make sure it's not a picture of their dog and say it's good. And at that point, I don't want the person to just like get, you know, just fall out of the scenario. I I just know that we're working. So it'll be like something like similar like it's it's been you know it's working and we can you know it's doing the AI validation something similar to this finalizing but it's not going to be as quick like this makes it seem like it's less than like two seconds but unfortunately the AI claims talking to Nate Fute is not that quick and then obviously the success is receive received you're all set if it's something that's not received or doesn't look right.  
   
 

### 00:02:18

   
**Nimo Parikh:** You'll see was uploaded successfully. A team will review it because maybe it didn't have all the pieces and then it was a specific error. Photo is too blurry. Picture your dog, etc. currently nonpr. So also the link would also say that if the receipts try to gets uploaded after 4 days you see that yeah unfortunately the link is expired please log into your benefits portal to basically upload your receipt and then this is the gentle reminder hey don't forget your receipt you know maybe we send it out in the same day or the next day in the morning or something like that.  
**Jessica Althaus:** Did we decide for sure on when the link expires though?  
**Nimo Parikh:** No, we didn't because I I wanted it on for like at least five days, but I don't think we got that final from the um Adam I think Adam because I think I say his name right,  
**Jessica Althaus:** Okay, I'm  
**Nimo Parikh:** right? I think he had the final say based on the link expiration.  
**Jessica Althaus:** in  
**Nimo Parikh:** Oh, I had to run it through him.  
   
 

### 00:04:03

   
**Nimo Parikh:** So, any critique, any feedback, any notes you want me to take on this item? I've I've asked Drew when we speak to him that I I want the clock added,  
**Jessica Althaus:** I just Oh,  
**Nimo Parikh:** but anything  
**Jessica Althaus:** yeah. I just need to look at the verbiage because we already had the team working on that and I don't know that  
**Nimo Parikh:** else?  
**Jessica Althaus:** it completely matches what we have.  
**Nimo Parikh:** No, this is not the final version.  
**Jessica Althaus:** But I'll I'll look. Yeah,  
**Nimo Parikh:** This is not Yeah.  
**Jessica Althaus:** I'll look. Yeah, I'll look and just make sure that that's because we'll if if  
**Nimo Parikh:** Okay.  
**Jessica Althaus:** we're demoing this or something, we'll want to make sure it's right.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Okay. And then I will send you the link because I have the link.  
**Jessica Althaus:** But  
**Nimo Parikh:** I don't know a lot of people didn't and then it didn't work for a while and now it works again. It's on both. But I I'll send everybody the link on this call.  
   
 

### 00:04:45

   
**Nimo Parikh:** But if you I know Drew didn't join this call, but if you have changes that we want to make for the demo or for the prototype, let me know because obviously I think we're going to have to tweak it as we launch this item because so far in our user testing, everybody said, "Oh yeah, this would absolutely make me take action." But the proof is in the pudding. Once we actually release this, I am hoping at the base 50% of more people take action and they upload the receipt. But that's remains to be seen because we have not launched this yet. So we might have to tweak the verbiage, make it like, you know, softer, prettier, I don't know, something.  
**Drew Hurley:** Do we I was not aware that we Is there a a follow-up reminder? I was not aware that we even had that.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yeah. Yeah. I had put that in in the last meeting that I wanted like a gentle reminder if the person didn't upload their receipt because, you know, I I I assume that Adam is probably going to say four or five days max on before the link expires.  
   
 

### 00:05:57

   
**Nimo Parikh:** And I assume that if the person did not take action within the next day or two after getting this SMS text or email, chances are they're not going to. So then we're back to the same process where they get a notification three, four weeks later, they don't supply the receipt and then they got to go dig it out or worse comes to worse, they don't they just ignore it and then their card gets suspended.  
**Jessica Althaus:** Yeah, I'll have to add a story for that because I don't have one for that for  
**Nimo Parikh:** Oh, for the reminder. Oh, okay.  
**Jessica Althaus:** No,  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, because I thought we had Did I miss on that? I thought we had spoke to that.  
**Jessica Althaus:** I think I think we've like thrown that around as like a maybe, but I didn't know we were doing that. So, I'll have to add that.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Okay, because I gave him these specific requirements for what I wanted. Obviously, there's a couple things missed like the clock and stuff like that, but I'm happy to go back and with input because he's like super good at this.  
   
 

### 00:06:51

   
**Nimo Parikh:** He can like fix it in like 10 minutes. Okay.  
**Jessica Althaus:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** And if you go to the prototype controls when I send you the link, you can basically simulate both like a success outcome, a under review outcome or an error outcome. It can go step by step depending on how you want to do it. All right.  
**Jessica Althaus:** He's  
**Nimo Parikh:** Either you guys are in complete agreement or I put you all to sleep.  
**Drew Hurley:** It's exciting seeing the, you know, the consumerf facing side of this taking shape. So,  
**Saurav Sharma:** Yeah,  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yeah,  
**Saurav Sharma:** definitely. I mean, we've been working on the back end of this. I forgot that this actually is a real feature that people are going to be using. So, it looks good.  
**Nimo Parikh:** you forgot. I was just doing the work just for s\*\*\*\* and giggles.  
**Saurav Sharma:** Yeah. Right. That's Sometimes it  
**Jessica Althaus:** Right.  
**Nimo Parikh:** All right. Um,  
**Saurav Sharma:** feels  
**Nimo Parikh:** yeah. I mean, obviously, maybe you guys don't have any input now, but if you think of anything or you wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning saying, "Oh, yeah, we should add this." let me know because obviously I'd like this to be as complete as possible when we get the landing  
   
 

### 00:08:10

   
**Nimo Parikh:** page. So that way, you know, we we we kind of have a good test case because I I'm not going to launch this with everybody. I'm going to try to pick out a partner or two and say, "Look, we're going to launch this with you as a beta and see how we do because chances are it's going to get it's going to need to get tweaked in some some manner.  
**Saurav Sharma:** Right. So, when are we going to roll this out? Like to which partner? And do we know the timeline for that?  
**Nimo Parikh:** I am working on the partner as we speak. It's difficult to get the beta partner to be honest, but I think I have some leads. Um, nothing definite. We are going to launch this in March. Um, so February and February 25th,  
**Saurav Sharma:** with  
**Nimo Parikh:** we're watching real-time notifications with merchant name. I'd like it to be a fast follow in March 25th or so to launch this landing page in a beta  
**Saurav Sharma:** that.  
   
 

### 00:09:00

   
**Nimo Parikh:** manner.  
**Saurav Sharma:** Okay.  
**Jessica Althaus:** Yeah, that's the that's the hope.  
**Saurav Sharma:** Yeah.  
**Jessica Althaus:** Hopefully, we can get it all done. Um,  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yeah.  
**Jessica Althaus:** are you when you're looking for a beta partner, Nemo, how are you doing that?  
**Nimo Parikh:** So, hold on.  
**Jessica Althaus:** I wonder if we could Okay,  
**Nimo Parikh:** Let me show you. Let me see if I I have that list still available. Hold on.  
**Jessica Althaus:** we'll just want to find a partner that has a lot of that they they have FSAs like not not a bunch of HSAs and then one that has obviously  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yes.  
**Jessica Althaus:** this enabled like SMS enabled for their  
**Nimo Parikh:** See,  
**Jessica Althaus:** population.  
**Nimo Parikh:** that's the key though. Most of them are not  
**Jessica Althaus:** Cool. Yeah. So,  
**Nimo Parikh:** like  
**Jessica Althaus:** I think you got to find one that already uses it because then maybe they I don't know. I think that would  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yeah.  
**Jessica Althaus:** be  
**Nimo Parikh:** I I need to go back to Sevis because Sevis had had a way of telling me based on my partner list which one had the most SMS people signed up for it,  
   
 

### 00:09:49

   
**Jessica Althaus:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** but I haven't gotten that information. But so there was um there was a I have to dig it out,  
**Jessica Althaus:** Okay.  
**Nimo Parikh:** but I I'll send it AC I'll send the link across and share it. But there was an item that I had looked at for like what I call partners or tech only partners that don't actually use us for claims. And I wanted to because Ann Jensen had worked them as well. I wanted to offer one of them to be a partner. They didn't have big lives. They only had like some of them had like a thousand to 2,000 lives. So, I wasn't going to go that big. Unless you guys think I need to go bigger because I didn't want to test it out on somebody like Bank of America. They were willing to test, believe it or  
**Jessica Althaus:** I mean,  
**Nimo Parikh:** not.  
**Jessica Althaus:** I don't I don't think I would be against it to be honest, but I think you have to go bigger because when you think about how often people  
   
 

### 00:10:40

   
**Nimo Parikh:** Really? Okay.  
**Jessica Althaus:** use their cards, like it's not like they use this every day like they use their bank card every day, you know.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yeah,  
**Jessica Althaus:** Um,  
**Nimo Parikh:** this is only like once a month maybe  
**Jessica Althaus:** so I think you need I mean not even I don't even use my card that often.  
**Nimo Parikh:** ops.  
**Jessica Althaus:** So like I just think we just have to think about maybe probably look at that and see how we're going to want to find someone with a decent amount  
**Nimo Parikh:** Okay.  
**Jessica Althaus:** of accounts that have SMS enabled. So otherwise we're not going to get very good.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Very good information, right? Yeah, I know. because we're I I want are you I guess are you opposed to because Bank of  
**Jessica Althaus:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** America I I poo pooed the idea because Bank of America I think her name was I forget the the RM's name but they they when we presented it to them they said that they'd be interested in piloting it but I know that they're not easy to work with and I don't know maybe I presented to them but you think that's too big of a case or I'm happy for the input if you think Bank of America is a candidate for  
   
 

### 00:11:52

   
**Jessica Althaus:** Well, I mean,  
**Nimo Parikh:** this.  
**Jessica Althaus:** I don't know. I haven't worked with Bank of America in a long time, but I mean, if they know it's a pilot um and that we're just kind of testing it with them and they're okay with that, then they should be aware of potential issues. I don't know. I don't I don't see Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** It increases the pressure on all of us. That's for sure. You test it out with something like Bank of America and it doesn't work the first time out the  
**Jessica Althaus:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** gate.  
**Jessica Althaus:** I don't know what have we looked there.  
**Drew Hurley:** Well, we have  
**Jessica Althaus:** Have we looked at their like how how many accounts they have?  
**Nimo Parikh:** Uh yeah, they they have a pretty  
**Jessica Althaus:** Uh how many but how many of those people have SMS  
**Nimo Parikh:** I No,  
**Jessica Althaus:** enabled like how many of the consumers  
**Nimo Parikh:** that's a good point. That hasn't been looked at. I do I I'll find the uh Excel doc I have that lists the partners by lives and obviously Bank of America has tons.  
   
 

### 00:12:52

   
**Jessica Althaus:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Oh, let me let me go into it right now that that you brought it up.  
**Jessica Althaus:** Mhm.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Let me let me see if I can find that doc.  
**Drew Hurley:** This can be enabled by by employer group as well. So if Bank of America identified one employer  
**Jessica Althaus:** Yeah. I was going to say, so also Yeah. I'm guessing if Bank of America is saying we're building to test this, they're probably thinking on one or two of their clients, like probably not their whole book, which is also something you could do with Direct.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yeah.  
**Jessica Althaus:** I'm sure Direct has some clients that would be willing to test this out, too. So, um I'm sure there's there's options, but I mean, probably partner's not going to be willing to turn it on for the whole book, I would think.  
**Nimo Parikh:** No,  
**Jessica Althaus:** I I Yeah,  
**Nimo Parikh:** that might be too many people. You  
**Jessica Althaus:** I think what they'll do is probably do a few select uh clients and then  
**Nimo Parikh:** know,  
   
 

### 00:13:45

   
**Jessica Althaus:** go from there. But you definitely need to find um a client that has a a decent amount of  
**Nimo Parikh:** real time notifications.  
**Jessica Althaus:** transactions.  
**Nimo Parikh:** All right, I I'll have to dig it out. I'll send you that. But I thought I Or maybe this that's this not it. I had a great Excel doc and now I can't find not Excel but Google sheet. Of course, I didn't wasn't ready for it. So, let me let me find it and then I'll I'll send it across. Um, Cardo account. Oh, here we go. Equity Bank. All right. So, this is not the the most upto-date, but I got to find the other one. But yeah, administrative. Uh, so these are these are the people that I had originally picked. So these people don't really have like they're tech only partners and they have like anywhere between 2,000 to something lives, but I do have some larger ones in there like HSA Bank. Um, but I think they don't have any FSA cards.  
   
 

### 00:15:20

   
**Nimo Parikh:** Um, Bamo Auto Management looks like they have like 20,000 cards. Um, they have a different I mean, Bank of America right here is 1.7 million cards.  
**Jessica Althaus:** Yeah, I think um without knowing what plans they have, it makes it tough to know who would a good Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** who's a good candidate, right?  
**Jessica Althaus:** Because if they primarily just have HSAs,  
**Nimo Parikh:** So,  
**Jessica Althaus:** this isn't gonna we need we need a partner that has FSAs. you know. So, I think we need a list that narrows that down a little bit  
**Nimo Parikh:** okay, Gibbs, can I ask you a question?  
**Jessica Althaus:** more.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Is there a way that you could run a query that says I want like the top 20 candidates that have FSA cards and the most people signed up for SMS or a percentage signed up for SMS? Is there even a query like that?  
**Gibbs Maynor:** um getting participants with a Benny card for notional plans. Yeah, that's pretty straightforward. um whether they have opted into SMS can be done. I don't have the query just like popping into my head.  
   
 

### 00:16:52

   
**Gibbs Maynor:** That would take a little  
**Nimo Parikh:** Okay,  
**Gibbs Maynor:** search.  
**Nimo Parikh:** I'll I mean if I can get the query of the folks that have the I I guess the bigger set of FSA cards, that would be a start. And then we can say if this is equitable, then maybe run a separate query on that set saying how many of their users are actually signed up for SMS.  
**Gibbs Maynor:** Right. Let's see.  
**Nimo Parikh:** And we could pick like from the direct group like from the direct group we have like Shard Snider, Wexel DBI and Wexel DBI has like 6.5 million lives.  
**Gibbs Maynor:** Where's that go?  
**Nimo Parikh:** Send that email out while you're looking at that item.  
**Gibbs Maynor:** Okay.  
**Nimo Parikh:** While Gibbs is going that I did send everybody the link. So, if you have any inputs or anything, let me know and I'll I'll log it down and then I'll set up a call with Drew if we need to change the prototype, you know, to to make it more representative to the teams.  
**Drew Hurley:** other Drew.  
   
 

### 00:20:24

   
**Drew Hurley:** We got to specify  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yeah. Drew Koliski, not Drew Hurley.  
**Gibbs Maynor:** s\*\*\*.  
**Nimo Parikh:** All  
**Gibbs Maynor:** Okay, hold on a second.  
**Nimo Parikh:** right.  
**Drew Hurley:** a roommate. Also, his was named Drew, but unlike me, his full name was Andrew. So, I feel like I got to claim claim the name  
**Nimo Parikh:** Did you guys all watch Zoo Bowl yesterday?  
**Gibbs Maynor:** Yeah. Yep.  
**Nimo Parikh:** No.  
**Jessica Althaus:** I didn't.  
**Nimo Parikh:** I wish I hadn't.  
**Jessica Althaus:** Are you a Patriots fan?  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yes.  
**Jessica Althaus:** I didn't watch the game. We were coming back from hockey tournament. So,  
**Nimo Parikh:** I'm glad you didn't see it. You didn't miss anything.  
**Jessica Althaus:** yeah. sounded.  
**Nimo Parikh:** It was painful. And then DraftKings took all my money. Yeah, it looks so easy to bet.  
**Jessica Althaus:** Dang.  
**Nimo Parikh:** But you can't win. Where are you? I did feel bad though to make up time. I did feel I saw Lindsay Juan unfortunately crash.  
   
 

### 00:23:23

   
**Nimo Parikh:** I did feel really bad for her.  
**Jessica Althaus:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** She was going all out to try to win something and man,  
**Jessica Althaus:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** brutal.  
**Jessica Althaus:** I kind of thought it was weird she was even trying though.  
**Nimo Parikh:** I know she had a little ruptured ACL, but you know, she knew this was the last time out the gate and you know, I wish she at least finished even she didn't win, but uh get airlifted. Not good. Not good.  
**Jessica Althaus:** I know that's that is true. But I kind of thought like when I first heard she was going to go for it, I thought it was kind of selfish. I was like, isn't there someone else that has a better chance? Um,  
**Nimo Parikh:** That's  
**Jessica Althaus:** you know, and I thought you kind of just took this shot away from someone else um that  
**Nimo Parikh:** true.  
**Jessica Althaus:** probably could have done better. I don't know. It's kind of like seemed seemed crazy to me, but I suppose she figured can't get any worse.  
   
 

### 00:24:22

   
**Nimo Parikh:** Maybe. But you know, the thing is to I I would think that there'd be like a doctor sign off, right? That this person is able to do it because it's not like they're just going for a walk in the park.  
**Jessica Althaus:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** They're doing 75 miles an hour and no ACL.  
**Jessica Althaus:** Yeah, I know.  
**Nimo Parikh:** I don't know. I don't know if there's like a right or wrong on that, but that's a good point. She did take someone else's spot.  
**Jessica Althaus:** Yeah.  
**Gibbs Maynor:** All  
**Nimo Parikh:** I I mean, if nobody has anything else, I'll I'll let everybody else go. I I don't want to hold you up here because uh maybe it takes longer than, you know, me just stating it for Gibbs to actually run the query. Yeah.  
**Gibbs Maynor:** right.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Okay. Do you need me to reach out to anybody else on that SMS thing that would maybe help that query or is just a matter of  
**Gibbs Maynor:** It's just a matter of time,  
**Nimo Parikh:** time?  
   
 

### 00:25:31

   
**Gibbs Maynor:** you know. I just do a little look up to validate the tables I need to look in.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Okay.  
**Gibbs Maynor:** And then Bob's your uncle.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. I don't want to put you under that pressure with the team waiting on you. So, whenever you get to it, that'd be great because obviously we're still working on the prototype, but I am putting out feelers for beta partners for the landing page.  
**Gibbs Maynor:** Okay. Uh, so we'd be looking at individual partners,  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yeah.  
**Gibbs Maynor:** uh, not business parties or would it be business parties?  
**Nimo Parikh:** Uh, I mean, somebody somebody could have like like a business party, but they have three different like like what I call admin aliases underneath  
**Gibbs Maynor:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** them. Um, so I I I would I mean if if it's feasible, I would just look for the business party that has the most FSA cards in our SMS enabled and then we can run it. you know, if we have a successful discussion, we run it down further because I don't I don't think we need to boil the ocean that level because I still don't have a a beta candidate.  
   
 

### 00:26:45

   
**Gibbs Maynor:** Okay.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yes, I just to catch you up. I know you joined a little late. I was going through the prototype that um me and uh I had given Drew all the information of what I wanted. I don't know if you remember it, but hey, let me just display it so you see it. Hold on. And I have a couple minutes because the call didn't go anywhere long as as I thought because Drew couldn't join.  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah, I noticed it wasn't there.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Um yeah, he he had he had to leave for an all day or something. So he he cancelled at the last minute,  
**Saviz Artang:** Okay.  
**Nimo Parikh:** but he's been pretty good about it. But so this is what the prototype looks like essentially.  
**Saviz Artang:** This is a phone version. There's a phone version.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Huh. A phone version.  
**Saviz Artang:** Is this Is this a phone format?  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yeah. Yeah. It has to be on phone.  
**Saviz Artang:** No, I understand.  
   
 

### 00:27:36

   
**Saviz Artang:** Oh, this is for the text message.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yeah, it's a text message. Yeah.  
**Saviz Artang:** Got it.  
**Nimo Parikh:** So, they they're going to get they're going to get a notification that, hey, your card was just authorized at Cairo X for $80. At that point, we're going to send them another text and URL saying it looks like this transaction needs a receipt, so please upload your receipt. So,  
**Saviz Artang:** Wait,  
**Nimo Parikh:** they go and they upload No,  
**Saviz Artang:** separate separate message or the same message as how much was spent? Okay. Got it.  
**Nimo Parikh:** it'll be the same message.  
**Saviz Artang:** Got it. Got it.  
**Nimo Parikh:** This is just a prototype. Don't I I had him break it out in steps so everybody saw it,  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah. Yeah. Got it.  
**Nimo Parikh:** but we can we can change it up anyway we want.  
**Saviz Artang:** All right.  
**Nimo Parikh:** So then it'll say like upload now and then it'll you know they'll click on to the URL  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah.  
   
 

### 00:28:19

   
**Nimo Parikh:** link, take a photo of the receipt.  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Once they take the photo of the receipt, then it's going to like what I call validate. But we have to change it up because the validation as talking to Nate Fuchs on that call, it's not that quick. It takes 15 to 20 seconds. So, we have to put some some clock on it or something that says,  
**Saviz Artang:** Yep.  
**Nimo Parikh:** "Hey, we're working on it." Because in his model,  
**Saviz Artang:** Yep.  
**Nimo Parikh:** it does this,  
**Saviz Artang:** Oh, okay.  
**Nimo Parikh:** right?  
**Saviz Artang:** Got it.  
**Nimo Parikh:** It makes it look like it's like super quick,  
**Saviz Artang:** Sure.  
**Nimo Parikh:** but it's not that quick.  
**Saviz Artang:** Sure.  
**Nimo Parikh:** You know what I mean?  
**Saviz Artang:** Sure.  
**Nimo Parikh:** And then either you have a success received,  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** you have something like you we couldn't correspond to items, it's under review,  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** you have a specific error saying, hey,  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** try it again,  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** right?  
   
 

### 00:29:03

   
**Nimo Parikh:** And then uh we also have if they try to use the link after 4 days because  
**Saviz Artang:** Sure.  
**Nimo Parikh:** you know what I mean? Because I think Adam is going to tell us that we can't use the link after a certain amount of days. You're going to go go to the benefits portal to upload your link.  
**Saviz Artang:** Sounds  
**Nimo Parikh:** And then the last one is if they haven't uploaded their receipt after the first day,  
**Saviz Artang:** good.  
**Nimo Parikh:** I want to send a gentle reminder. Hey, don't forget about your receipt.  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah. So, everything you said is all doable and is part of our plan.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yeah.  
**Saviz Artang:** The gentle reminder is not.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yes. I I I thought I had discussed that item because I know I had spoken with Jess on this  
**Saviz Artang:** No, I mean you might have mentioned it,  
**Nimo Parikh:** item.  
**Saviz Artang:** but like we don't have any mechanisms right now to send any other. So right now we're sort of piggybacking on existing rails to send this new one.  
   
 

### 00:29:49

   
**Saviz Artang:** The you need you need another event to wake up to do the gentle reminder.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Okay.  
**Saviz Artang:** We don't have an event for that right now.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Oh,  
**Saviz Artang:** Does that make sense?  
**Nimo Parikh:** okay. Yeah. Yeah. Even if we release the gentle reminder after the second,  
**Saviz Artang:** Right.  
**Nimo Parikh:** you know,  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** the the second phrase, I'm okay of it because obviously I would love for people for me to send me this.  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** I send them the notification and that's the number one item on their list.  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** They can't live without it.  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** But I know we're gonna have to send a notification  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah. Now, and Gibbs, do you have any thoughts on what's the easiest way to implement the gentle  
**Nimo Parikh:** sometime.  
**Saviz Artang:** reminder?  
**Gibbs Maynor:** We we'd need a new service,  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  
**Gibbs Maynor:** something that would look at  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah. Review review all the messages that have gone out and anything that doesn't have an image.  
   
 

### 00:30:27

   
**Gibbs Maynor:** a  
**Saviz Artang:** Actually, we don't know if they clicked on it. Okay,  
**Gibbs Maynor:** Well, we  
**Saviz Artang:** we have to sort that  
**Nimo Parikh:** Could we do something funny though? Could we do something funny like Mr.  
**Saviz Artang:** out.  
**Nimo Parikh:** T saying, "Hey fool,  
**Gibbs Maynor:** have  
**Nimo Parikh:** upload your receipt." Like something like that.  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** I mean,  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** because everybody does the same thing. You know, a gentle reminder, but maybe like a like a reminder with Mr.  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** T or somebody. We just pay him something. So, you know what I mean?  
**Saviz Artang:** You probably get into trouble using Mr.  
**Nimo Parikh:** You get that like a day later.  
**Saviz Artang:** T, though. You probably get into trouble using Mr.  
**Nimo Parikh:** What?  
**Saviz Artang:** T. I'm sure it's uh  
**Nimo Parikh:** Oh, really? Oh, I thought Mr.  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** T was universally loved. No, not true.  
**Saviz Artang:** No, I mean the problem is not the message,  
**Nimo Parikh:** Okay.  
   
 

### 00:31:10

   
**Saviz Artang:** the wording. We can do whatever you want. The problem is we don't have an event that goes and looks at all the ones that have gone out to see which one has not been responded  
**Nimo Parikh:** Right. Right.  
**Saviz Artang:** to and then create a new event for that.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Okay.  
**Saviz Artang:** So, we kind of need I don't know.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yeah.  
**Saviz Artang:** Can't be a nightly job. It has to like run hourly, right, Gibbs?  
**Gibbs Maynor:** Oh, some sort of schedule,  
**Nimo Parikh:** I think you  
**Gibbs Maynor:** you know, whatever that is.  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah. All right. There's a couple of things to consider also,  
**Nimo Parikh:** could.  
**Saviz Artang:** Nemo, because this is a this is an SMS. So,  
**Gibbs Maynor:** Um,  
**Saviz Artang:** what if somebody purchased something at 1:00 a.m. and then if we have a 24h hour on it so that we can tell them give them a nudge after 24 hours? We probably don't want to give them the nudge at 1:00 a.m. So, we probably have quiet hours.  
   
 

### 00:31:52

   
**Nimo Parikh:** No, no. Right.  
**Saviz Artang:** So, all that has to be taken into account.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Uh, we probably have to put it on a like a delay clock or something.  
**Saviz Artang:** Right. Right.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yeah. Okay. That's something that we need to discuss and that can be the second phase of it.  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** And you know, I'd like to have fun with the reminder if it's possible.  
**Saviz Artang:** Well, it's it's your business.  
**Nimo Parikh:** You know what I  
**Saviz Artang:** I mean, as far as like what do you want to say in it,  
**Nimo Parikh:** mean?  
**Saviz Artang:** you can be as casual as you want, but I have a feeling somebody like Jennifer is going to poo poo that, but I don't know. It's not my call.  
**Nimo Parikh:** I know.  
**Saviz Artang:** We can do you can do whatever you want.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yeah. But I I I kind of wanted to have some fun with it,  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** but I don't know if that's going to, you know,  
   
 

### 00:32:24

   
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Wex might be the no fun card. You can't have Mr. T,  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah,  
**Nimo Parikh:** hey fool,  
**Saviz Artang:** yeah,  
**Nimo Parikh:** upload your receipt.  
**Saviz Artang:** yeah, yeah, yeah. Also, they might they might think it's a spam.  
**Nimo Parikh:** But that would that that would it would get noticed. It would get noticed right away.  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah, yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yeah.  
**Saviz Artang:** All right.  
**Nimo Parikh:** All right.  
**Saviz Artang:** Okay,

**Nimo Parikh:** Yeah.  
**Saviz Artang:** but I'll read it as soon as possible.  
**Nimo Parikh:** Yeah. Yeah. If you have any any updates or comments because I know Drew couldn't join today.  
   
 

### 00:32:55

   
**Saviz Artang:** Okay.  
**Nimo Parikh:** I just wanted him to do the clock and things like that,  
**Saviz Artang:** Yeah.  
**Nimo Parikh:** but I can update him because he's super good at it.

**Saviz Artang:** All  
**Nimo Parikh:** All right. And then just let you know,  
**Saviz Artang:** right.  
**Nimo Parikh:** before you joined, I asked Gibbs to run me a query. um doesn't have to be done right away for the partners with the most FSA folks. Uh and they have the what their percentage of SMS signups are because obviously that would be a better beta case because I want to push SMS more than anything else.  
**Saviz Artang:** Yep. Yep.  
**Nimo Parikh:** So yeah,  
**Saviz Artang:** I think we should push us. We should push We should We should have a campaign,  
**Nimo Parikh:** and I thank Gibs for doing that.  
**Saviz Artang:** Nemo. Maybe you want to talk to marketing. We should have a campaign to have people put their phone numbers in. Right now, we hardly have any. Yeah. Yeah. Agreed.
